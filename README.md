Welcome to the source code for my personal portfolio website. This site is a single-page application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to showcase my skills, projects, and professional journey as an aspiring software developer.


## 🚀 About Me

Hi, I’m **Shiv Pratap Singh**, a B.Tech Computer Science student at IIIT Manipur with a strong passion for Full-Stack Development and Problem Solving. I have solid experience in Data Structures and Algorithms (C++) and enjoy tackling coding challenges to enhance my problem-solving skills. My focus lies in building dynamic and responsive web applications while continuously learning and growing as a developer.

This portfolio highlights my journey, the technologies I work with, and the projects I've built.

## ✨ Key Features

* **Single-Page Layout:** Smooth-scrolling navigation to all sections (Home, About, Projects, Skills, Contact).
* **Dynamic Hero Section:** An animated "typed.js" effect cycles through my roles (Software Developer, Full Stack Developer, etc.).
* **Interactive UI:** A subtle parallax-style animation on the hero section icons that reacts to mouse movement.
* **Project Showcase:** A clean, organized section detailing my key projects, complete with:
    * Live demo links.
    * Links to GitHub repositories.
    * Icons for the tech stack used in each project.
* **Comprehensive Skills:** A visual display of my technical skills across frontend, backend, databases, and DevOps.
* **Contact Form:** A built-in form for visitors to get in touch with me.
* **Responsive Design:** The layout is fully responsive and optimized for all devices, from mobile phones to desktops.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

This portfolio website itself is built using:

* **HTML5:** For the core structure and content.
* **CSS3:** For all styling, layout (Flexbox/Grid), and animations.
* **JavaScript (ES6+):** For DOM manipulation, the "typed.js" effect, and the mouse-move animations.
* **Font Awesome:** For social media and navigation icons.
